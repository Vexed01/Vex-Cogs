    "description": "Replace the uptime command with a rich embed that shows the bot's percentage uptime (both time of the bot being on and time connected to Discord). There is also a new `downtime` command which shows when downtime happened. This cog writes to config every 60 seconds to prevent data loss. It is also very storage efficient, using under 150 bytes each day the cog runs.",

    "install_msg": "Thanks for installing! This cog will replace the default `uptime` command once you load it.\n\nWhilst the cog will start showing data from first load, it will ignore today's data from tomorrow onwards. Once the cog's been running for a while, data over 30 days old will no longer be counted in the `uptime` command.\n\nThis cog has docs! Check them out at <https://go.vexcodes.com/c/betteruptime>",
