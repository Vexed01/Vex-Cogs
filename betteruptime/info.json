    "install_msg": "Thanks for installing! This cog will replace the default `uptime` command. The difference from Core's uptime command is that is shows the uptime percentage of the bot running and the percentage connected to Discord.\nThis cog writes to config every 60 seconds to prevent data loss. It is also very storage efficient, using under 150 bytes each day the cog runs.\n\n**Please carefully read the information bellow about some of the cog's inner workings.**\n\nWhen you first load the cog, the `uptime` command will say **data may be inaccurate** for first 15 minutes. The cog does try to correct for this as much as possible, so uptime percentages will 'snap' to 100.0% if downtime is only a few seconds. As well as this, the cog will not show the total downtime in minutes if it's under a couple minutes.\n\nWhilst the cog will start showing data from first load, it will ignore all data collected on the UTC date of first load from tomorrow.\n\nOnce the cog's been running for a while, data over 30 days old will no longer be counted in the `uptime` command.\n\nPlease avoid excessively reloading the cog. Whilst it tries to clean up to prevent data loss, there will still be a second or so of downtime added. As well as this, sometimes it can't clean up properly so there could be up to a minute's worth of data loss.\n\nThis cog has docs! Check them out at <https://cogdocs.vexcodes.com/en/latest/cogs/betteruptime.html>",
