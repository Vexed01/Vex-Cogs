Start a button-based poll

This is an interactive setup. By default the current channel will be used,
but if you want to start a poll remotely you can send the channel name
along with the buttonpoll command.

**Examples:**
- ``[p]buttonpoll`` - start a poll in the current channel
- ``[p]buttonpoll #polls`` start a poll somewhere else
