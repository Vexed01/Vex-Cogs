    "end_user_data_statement": "This cog may persistently store data or metadata about users. Operational data is temporarily collected and cached whenever a command is used and may be stored.\n\nWhen a command is used, the following data is collected: the message invoking the command, the user that invoked it, the server it was invoked in, and the channel it was invoked in. This includes application commands, as well as old-style text commands.\n\nThis cog does not support data deletion requests, as it handles operational data.",
    "install_msg": "This cog will immediately start tracking commands once you have loaded it. They are logged with the `logging` module, so they'll appear in the bot's console or main logs (search for `red.vex.cmdlog`). An internal cache is kept, which you can see in Discord with the `[p]cmdlog` command.\n\nIf you want to store the whole message content, including arguments, instead of just the command invoked, run `[p]cmdlog content true` once you've loaded the cog.\n\nThis cog has docs!
