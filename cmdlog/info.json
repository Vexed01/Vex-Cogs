They are logged with the logging `logging` module, so they'll appear in the bot's console or main logs (search for `red.vex.cmdlog`) and an internal cache is kept which you can see in Discord with the `cmdlog` command.\n\nIf you want to store the whole message content, including arguments, instead of just the command invoked run `[p]cmdlog content true` once you've loaded the cog.\n\nThis cog has docs!
