This is just around 50MB per year (the cog will NOT automatically delete old data so this will increase over time). It uses an SQLite database that requires no extra setup. RAM usage will be at least double disk usage and may spike to more when commands are used or the loop is active. All other commands are under `stattrack`\n\n**Once you load the cog, please wait a few seconds then run the `stattrackinfo` command. If the 'loop time' is None then wait a bit and try again. When it appears, if it's over 30 seconds __you should not use this cog on your bot.__**",
