This is just around 50MB per year (the cog will NOT delete old data so this will increase). RAM usage grows at around the same rate as disk usage for the cog. You can see storage usage with the `stattrackinfo` command. All other commands are under `stattrack`\n\n**Once you load the cog, please wait a few seconds then run the `stattrackinfo` command. If the 'loop time' is None then wait a bit and try again. When it appears, if it's over 30 seconds __you should not use this cog on your bot.__**",
